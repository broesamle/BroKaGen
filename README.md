Br:oKaGen - The Br:osamle Katalog Generator
===========================================

Organise texts, image content, list/item-centred information 
(such as publications list, curriculum vita, exhibitions, talks, etc.) 
into a coherent and pleasant form for screen, presentation, print. 

+ Static HTML Generator
+ Purely based on HTML, (inline) SVG, CSS
+ Articles are registered in (multiple) rubriques
+ Rubriques allow for specific spatial graphic elements and styling
+ An overall Catalogue/Main index is generated...
+ ... as well as sub-catalogues for each rubrique
+ Efficient visual and hyperlink access via the margin of the main catalogue

Recently I have been using the generator as a substitute for Keynote/Powerpoint-Type of presentation systems:
+ platform independent firm integration with web content
+ more structured and, at the same time, flexible presentation style

ToDos and Open Ends
===================
 ... it's more work-in-progress-ish than settled

Create a Template Project
-------------------------
Currently, only the engine is in the repo...

Making a presentation will at some point become more straight forward based on suitable templates:

1. Checkout the generator
2. Adapt the template `CFG_*` files appropriately (Rubriques, Icons)

3. Define Logo

Clean logging
-------------
There should be logging levels so that warnings (i.e. about ignored input files) can be read separately from more general infos.
